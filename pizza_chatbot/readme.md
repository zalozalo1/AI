# Zalo's Pizzeria AI Chatbot

This is a command-line pizza ordering chatbot powered by the Google Gemini API. It simulates a conversation with a pizzeria chatbot to take a user's order, tracks all items, and provides a final, priced summary.

## Features

- **Conversational Ordering**: Engages the user in a natural, friendly conversation.
- **Dynamic Menu Navigation**: Handles both specialty pizzas and custom "build-your-own" orders.
- **Order Management**: Accurately tracks choices for pizza size, crust, toppings, sides, and drinks.
- **Automatic Pricing**: Calculates the price for each item and the total order cost upon completion.
- **Styled CLI**: Presents the bot's messages and the final order summary in a clean, formatted interface.
